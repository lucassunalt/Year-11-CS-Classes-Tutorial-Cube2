# Reflection

Learning: I have strengthened my understanding of Java class design, specifically how to implement multiple constructors to handle different initialization scenarios (chaining constructors using `this()`). I also learned how to encapsulate logic by adding validation in setter methods and reusing that validation in constructors. Additionally, implementing the `add` and `minus` methods reinforced how to manipulate object state to create new immutable instances based on mathematical properties (in this case, Pythagorean relationships between cube sides).
